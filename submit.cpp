//Life function
void life(int *a, unsigned int n, unsigned int iter, int *livecount)
{
    // You need to store the total number of livecounts for every 1/0th of the total iterations into the livecount array.
	// For example, if there are 50 iterations in your code, you need to store the livecount for iteration number 5 10 15
	// 20 ... 50. The countlive function is defined in life.cpp, which you can use. Note that you can
	// do the debugging only if the number of iterations is a multiple of 10.
	// Furthermore, you will need to wrap your counting code inside the wrapper #if DEBUG == 1 .. #endif to remove
	// it during performance evaluation.
	// For example, your code in this function could look like -
	//
	//
	//	for(each iteration)
	//      {
	//
	//		Calculate_next_life();
	//
	//		#if DEBUG == 1
	//		  if_current_iteration == debug_iteration
	//		  total_lives = countlive();
	//		  Store_into_livecount(total_lives);
	//		#ENDIF
	//
	//	}
